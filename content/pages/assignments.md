There are three basic, escalating assignments. (1) MiniMap - pick a preliminary technology area and prepare a MiniMap by Week 3. You may do this as individuals or teams. A MiniMap is a “quick’n’dirty” 5-10 PowerPoint slideshow highlighting key information about your area of interest and the top open questions and concerns you and industry players have about future technology trends. (2) Update - hone in on your principal technology area and work intensively to prepare your roadmap. You’ll be presenting 5-10 slide updates on your TRM effort, highlighting especially things which you think are unique to your sector, especially worth sharing, open areas of concern and uncertainty, and so forth. This is not intended to be a final presentation or performance. (3) TRM Finale - prepare a logical and exhaustive TRM compilation by the end of the semester. While this is necessarily a “living document” and we fully expect you and/or future students to extend and expand on it, nevertheless we would like this to be as complete a snapshot of understanding in your technology-industry sector as possible. Between the Update and the Finale, we will be formally meeting.
